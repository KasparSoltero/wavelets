Implementation of the discrete wavelet transform and associated processing functions.

functions:
multires (Multiple-resolution analysis) repeatedly decomposes the approximate coefficients
Because the approximate coefficients represent the low frequency part of the signal,
each level analyses a lower frequency portion of the signal.

This process of multi-resolution analysis is shown below:

[signal]──┬─>[cD1] ┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄┄[cD1]        level 1
            └─>[cA1]──┬─>[cD2]┄┄┄┄┄[cD2]        level 2
                    └─>[cA2]──┬─>[cD3]        level 3
                                └─>[cA3]

Each decomposition splits the signal into a higher and lower frequency component,
so the frequencies spanned by the final sets of coefficients
for a signal sampled at 1000 Hz, decomposed to level 3 as above would be:

    cD1: 1000 - 500 Hz
    cD2: 500 - 250 Hz
    cD3: 250 - 125 Hz
    cA3: 125 - 0 Hz

# inverseMultires reconstructs the original signal from the
    # set of coefficients generated by multi-resolution analysis.

    # This process works in reverse to multi-resolution decomposition,
    # iteratively reconstructing each approximate coefficient array from the lower level:

    # [cD1]──────────────────────┬─>[signal]
    # [cD2]────────────┬─>[cA1]──┘
    # [cD3]──┬─>[cA2]──┘
    # [cA3]──┘
